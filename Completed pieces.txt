well, we aren't nearly as done as I wanted to be.


I built:

	pathfinding, 
	2 enemy types,
	player movement and shooting
	HUD - score is working, health is not. Actually having lots of trouble with health
	lots of materials - the bullets are my favorite. they have moving images on them. 

errors
	sometimes the enemies just seem to ride the bullets. 
	my_bullet takes away player health
	enemy_charger only sometimes damages player.
